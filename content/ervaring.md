### Bytecode Digital Agency */ Co-founder & technical lead*

##### 01-05-2018 to PRESENT

Nooijen Web Solutions consisted of a team of collaborating freelancers. However, we noticed that this could cause problems with the ever larger projects, partly because we did not have our own office. This is why Bytecode Digital Agency B.V. was founded. The same team, but now a really permanent team (currently 9 permanent employees), instead of a group of freelancers. From 1 July 2018 we have our own office in Delfgauw from where we work.

At Bytecode, I fulfill the role of lead-developer and am ultimately responsible for almost everything in the technical field and the delivered products. I am also involved in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering.

For more information about Bytecode, see [bytecode.nl](https://bytecode.nl).

##### Used techniques (most commonly used in bold)

**DevOps**: Ansible, Docker, Linux, Terraform, GitLab
**Backend**: Go, NodeJS/Deno, Elixir, Rest, Python
* Frontend: Typescript, ReactJS (+Redux), React Native
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL

### Eneco/Dept */ Software Consultant, ad interim*

##### 01-01-2020 to 31-02-2020

After completion of the initial development, I was asked to continue providing advice and support during the period of scaling up when the large-scale product was going live. This means that I took care of a transfer of support from the feature-team to a larger, already existing team.

My work here mainly consisted of improving the existing structure, documenting the built product, performing code reviews and providing support where needed.

### Eneco/Dept */ Software Engineer, ad interim*

##### 13-05-2019 to 31-12-2019

Through [DEPT](https://deptagency.com), I helped Eneco to develop a tool that will play a crucial role in Eneco's customer-journey, by being able to give customers personal advice on how to become more sustainable, based on their "profile" and living situation.

I've also been involved in platform-wide improvements in the front-end. I've been involved in accelerating the development-environment and integrating Redux within the codebase. In addition, I provided advice on the source code architecture of the front-end.

The technology-"stack" used is based on Typescript/Javascript, including ReactJS, Redux and Styled-Components. Project management is based on the Agile/Scrum philosophy. To guarantee the quality of the software, unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests (with Jest, Enzyme and Cypress) are used for test-automation. In addition, where possible development is test-driven.

### Stager Software */ Front-end/full-stack developer*

##### 01-12-2017 to 01-06-2018

At Stager I worked as a front-end/full-stack developer on Stagers ticketing service. At Stager we work in a scrum team with two-week sprints. Within this scrum-team I mainly worked on the front-end issues, but if things had to be changed in the Java backend, that wasn't a problem for me either.

### Chemiewinkel.com */ Owner/founder*

##### 01-07-2014 to 31-12-2018

In the summer holidays during high school, I think I was around 15 years old, I started the webshop Chemiewinkel.com out of a passion for chemistry. Before this, I had worked with WordPress for some smaller projects, but of course this was a great way to get to know the framework better. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue this project, because I wanted to be able to fully focus on Bytecode.

###### Techniques

* PHP
* WordPress + WooCommerce
* jQuery
