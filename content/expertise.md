With more than a decade under my belt in software development, I have dealt with a tremendous amount of programming languages and frameworks, while specializing in a handful. Although I have my preferences, I will always pick the technology that makes the most sense for a project, both short- and long-term.

I have experience in hands-on software development positions, as well as leadership positions, with responsibilities that extend further than lines of code (determining roadmaps, mentoring developers, business decisions).

## Learning

Currently, I spend around 20 hours per week on self-education. Some of it focused on computer science, most of it on other subjects (like philosophy, history and linguistics). You can read more on my [learning page](/learning).
