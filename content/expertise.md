In the past ten years of programming, I have dealt with a tremendous amount of programming languages and frameworks, from C to Ruby on Rails and from Java 6 to Python Django. As a result, I have figured out which languages and frameworks suit me best, and how I can achieve the best results to best meet the needs of the end user.

In recent years I have specialised in a few stacks, as can be read below. Although of course I have my preferences, I will always choose _the best tool for the job_, regardless of my perfonal preference.

I have worked both as a hands-on software engineer and as a technical lead, with responsibilities that go beyond just software development (software architecture, training developers with new technologies, determining the feature road map).

## Learning

Currently, I spend around 20 hours per week on self-education. Some of it focused on computer science, most of it on other subjects (like philosophy, history and linguistics). You can read more on my [learning page](/learning).

The old learning page is archived [here](/archive/learning).
