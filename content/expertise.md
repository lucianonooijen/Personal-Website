In the past ten years of programming, I have dealt with an enormous amount of programming languages and frameworks, from C to Ruby on Rails and from Java 6 to Python Django. As a result, I have figured out which languages and frameworks suit me best, and how I can achieve the best results to best meet the needs of the end user.

In recent years I have specialised in a few stacks, as can be read below. Although of course I have my preferences, I will always choose _the best tool for the job_, regardless of my preference.

Unless the project requires otherwise, I program according to Bytecode's Coding Standards. The Coding Standards can be found [here](https://github.com/BytecodeBV/Coding-Standards).

Since about a year, I fill the role of Technical Lead at Bytecode. This means that I only spend a small part of my time writing code myself, because I am more involved with software architecture, the design of the code at a higher level, performing code reviews and guiding the developers at Bytecode. Of course, there are still plenty of times when I do write code myself.

## Working method

*Technologies I use to deliver elegant, efficient, readable, understandable and maintainable code that adds value to a company and/or product.*

* "Always choose the best tool for the job"
* Cloud and application structure using [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
* Software architecture through the principles of [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [Layered Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture).
* Prevention of [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt), short term and long term
* Everything (even [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)) in version control (Git) via [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
* Project management via SCRUM/Agile principle, without unnecessary meetings
* Bringing together Development, Security and Operations through [DevSecOps](https://www.devsecops.org/) and [secure by design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design).
* Prioritise via the [MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) and the [80 / 20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).
* Development on the basis of Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Functional programming where possible
* [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) code
* Versioning according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
* Use of [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) to improve readability, performance and maintainability
* Use of free (open-source) software where possible

## Learning

Currently, I spend around 20 hours per week on self-education. Some of it focused on computer science, most of it on other subjects (like philosophy, history and linguistics). You can read more on my [learning page](/learning).

The old learning page is archived [here](/archive/learning).
