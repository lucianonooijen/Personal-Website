#### Introduction

Because my availability and preferences for projects change regularly, I have added this page to my website, specifically for recruiters, where I can answer most questions.

To read about me as a person and my background, go to the [about](/over)-page.

### Availability and travel time

**Currently I am/~not~ available for a freelance assignment**.

*After years of enjoying work as a full-stack developer, I have the ambition to only take on projects with a strong focus on software architecture, infrastructure and systems integration.*

My availability per week is currently:

* In the context of my lead work at Bytecode a total of 24 hours a week
* Maximum 1 day (or 2 half days) at the customer's site
* In addition a maximum of 2 days remote

Currently I have an hourly rate of â‚¬130. This hourly rate includes travel and accommodation costs, and excludes sales tax.

I live in Delfgauw, and am open for projects with a maximum travel time of 20 minutes by car.

_My preference is for a project with an initial duration of 3-6 months, with extension in consultation_.

#### Techniques

*In order to deliver the highest possible value by delivering a high quality solution, it is important to me that [<b> my working method</b>](/expertise#working method) can be implemented in projects.*

My preference is for projects where I work closely with the CTO/CIO of a company, lead developers and/or software architects, or where I fulfill one of these roles.

Currently I am available for a project with one or more of the following techniques, or a project where these techniques can be implemented:

* Golang, Typescript or Kotlin/Java for the back-end.
* ReactJS (+Redux) for the front-end
* React Native (+Expo) for mobile
* DevOps/Cloud automation with Linux environments
* Site Reliability Engineering

_Unfortunately it is not possible for me to work with environments that require the Windows operating system._

If there were also a focus on security aspects, that would be ideal.

To read more about my skillset, go to the [expertise page](/expertise). Here, my working method is also explained in more detail.

#### Work and sector

I like variety very much, so I don't have a strong preference to work in a certain sector, or in a specific role that I would take on, but of course I have things that mainly interest me.

My interests are mainly:

* _Software architecture_ and determining the direction in the technical field within companies
* The _inventing_ and _developing_ of internal tools to improve and accelerate (development) processes.
* _Consultancy_ in the IT field, and creating and translating requirements into the best technical interpretation
* Supervising teams_ within a company and _technical project management_, by fulfilling the role of _technical lead_.
* _IT automation_ within a company and _systems integration_ (creating links between different applications)
* Contributions to _open-source/free software projects_ of companies
* Businesses _modernise_ in IT (e.g. from on-premise applications to microservices in public cloud)
* _Startups_ where software is the main focus, where important decisions have to be made about _software architecture_.

_I am open to both greenfield and brownfield projects, with a preference for [greenfield](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-brownfield-project-and-greenfield-projects)._

#### Team and mindset

Just as important as the work, I find the team and the mindset.

Because I'm very passionate about what I do, I think it's important that the people I work with are too, because I believe that's the way to achieve the very best results.

Within a team, I find it important that there is a culture that motivates people to write clean code and where quality of the software is paramount, so a mindset that fits [my way of working](https://lucianonooijen.nl/expertise/#werkwijze).

Whether the team is English-speaking or Dutch-speaking does not matter to me, because I master the English language on a near-native level.
