### About me

My name is Luciano Nooijen, a web/mobile and DevOps consultant. Currently, I work as technical lead at [Bytecode Digital Agency B.V.](https://bytecode.nl), an agency I co-founded.

#### Career

I started programming when I was quite young. In 2009 I created my first website, but from 2014 on I started working as a developer professionally.

I first started my professional career freelancing, under the name of Nooijen Web Solutions. The amount of projects grew rapidly, and soon I had to involve other freelancers to help me out.

After a few years during which business kept growing, Jeroen, a close and supportive friend, and I decided to join forces and found an agency. We started Bytecode Digital Agency, Bytecode for short.

#### Education

In 2017 I finished VWO, the highest level of Dutch high school. Afterwards, I followed some Computer Science and Engineering courses at Delft University of Science.

During my time as a professional, I have always been very self-tought. While attending University, I felt that I could achieve more learning the way I had always done. I decided to quit University and focus on self-education instead.

Even though I always try to find the most practical solution, I do see the value of knowing the foundations of computer science, which are usually taught at Universities, and not just software engineering. For this reason I also focused a lot on algorithms and algorithm design, cryptography and datastructures.

#### Courses

In 2016 I became Anglia Proficiency certified, graded "Distinction". This implies that I can speak, read and write on at least C1 level ("effective operational proficiency or advanced") on the [CEFRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) scale.
