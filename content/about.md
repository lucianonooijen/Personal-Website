#### Introduction

My name is Luciano Nooijen, co-founder of [Bytecode Digital Agency B.V.](https://bytecode.nl) where I currently fulfil the role of technical lead.

#### Work

After years of pleasure working as a full-stack developer, I started to specialize in software architecture, infrastructure and systems integration, while I still like to do quite a bit of coding myself.

In my work I mainly focus on identifying the needs of organizations, and creating solutions that meet those needs. In this way I combine my passion for technology with the fulfillment of business requirements.

What motivates me to do this work every day is to see how the applications I have worked on take an organization to a next level and make it possible for people within the organization to focus on what they are passionate about.

Within my work (cyber) security also plays a major role. At Bytecode, I take care of the security of both the servers and the applications that run on these servers.

#### Career

I started programming at an early age. In 2009 I made my first website, after having been interested in computers and software from an early age. After making this first website, I continued to broaden my knowledge, which enabled me to apply my skills on a professional level from 2014.

In 2014 I developed my own webshop in WooCommerce and started to develop websites under the name Nooijen Web Solutions. After a while I started working together with [Jeroen van Steijn](https://jeroenvansteijn.nl), with whom I later founded Bytecode, and where I am currently working with an awesome 11-headed team.

### Education

In 2017 I completed my VWO education at the Stanislascollege in Pijnacker. Afterwards I studied Computer Science and Engineering at Delft University of Technology for about half a year. However, I am very self-taught, and the programme did not fit in well with what I wanted to achieve and the way I learn best. I didn't feel challenged enough, and I felt I could learn more and better in the way I always did, although I later realized this route has challenges of it's own.

In addition to practical applications, I also started to delve into theoretical matters surrounding computer science, because I see the value of the reasons for doing something in a certain way, rather than just learning that it should be done that way. For example, I have been involved in low-level programming, algorithms, data structures and other issues that tend to be more computer science rather than just software development.

In 2020, I came to a realization that even though I can make great impact with the work I do, there was still a feeling that there was more I could achieve. I considered going to University to get formal education about the true fundamentals to be able to understand what I do at the electrical engineering level, but I chose to go the self-education route here too.

On my dedicated [learning page](/learning) you can read more about my learning journey, the goals I want to achieve doing this and the path I take to get there, as well as the reasoning behind it all.

#### Certificates

In 2016 I obtained my Anglia Proficiency certificate with a "Distinction" grade. This shows that I master the English language on at least C1 level on the [CEFRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) scale.

#### Leisure

Because I strongly believe in free(/open source) software, I try to contribute as much as possible with the development for which I am responsible, with Bytecode and beyond.

In my spare time I like to watch American Football (New York Giants) or baseball (Los Angeles Dodgers), and I like to play and watch snooker games.
