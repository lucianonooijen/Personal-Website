#### Introduction

My name is Luciano Nooijen, currently working in the games industry as an engineer focusing on online game client development and multiplayer functionality. 

My current position is technical lead at Companion Group, a co-development agency focussing on multiplayer games.

#### Work

Although I was introduced to software engineering via website development, I have quickly moved more towards back-end development, integration work and site-reliability engineering. My work often includes work related to build automation, data processing and optimization. Given the chance, I love to work on compilers and low-level systems programming. 

A few years ago, I was given the opportunity to enter the gaming industry, in which I currently work in various positions on various projects (details on my [experience page](/experience)), working mostly with Unreal Engine, C++ and various back-end technologies, mostly Golang and C#. Where necessary, I use my experience in web development to assist in the development of internal web-based tooling used during the game development process.

With my knowledge about both theoretical computer science and my broad practical experience for many different companies, my aim is to not to create cookie-cutter solutions, but to create software tailored for the specific use-case that is build to last and is easy to maintain for years to come.

Within my work (cyber) security also plays a major role, both at the application level and at the server level.

#### Career

I started programming at an early age. In 2009 I made my first website, after having been interested in computers and software from an early age. After making this first website, I continued to broaden my knowledge, which enabled me to apply my skills on a professional level from 2014.

In 2014 I developed my own webshop in WooCommerce and started to develop websites under the name Nooijen Web Solutions. After a while I started working together with Jeroen van Steijn, with whom I later founded Bytecode, which evolved into a start-up focussed digital agency. Though Bytecode, I have co-founded multiple start-ups and assumed the position of technical lead in others, leading the development of their software products.

### Education

In 2017 I completed my VWO education at the Stanislascollege in Pijnacker. Afterwards I studied Computer Science and Engineering at Delft University of Technology for about half a year. However, I am very self-taught, and the programme did not fit in well with what I wanted to achieve and the way I learn best. I didn't feel challenged enough, and I felt I could learn more and better in the way I always did, although I later realized this route has challenges of it's own.

In addition to practical applications, I also started to delve into theoretical matters surrounding computer science, because I see the value of the reasons for doing something in a certain way, rather than just learning that it should be done that way. For example, I have been involved in low-level programming, algorithms, data structures and other issues that tend to be more computer science rather than just software development.

In 2020, I came to a realization that even though I can make great impact with the work I do, there was still a feeling that there was more I could achieve. I considered going to University to get formal education about the true fundamentals to be able to understand what I do at the electrical engineering level, but I chose to go the self-education route here too.

On my dedicated [learning page](/learning) you can read more about my learning journey, the goals I want to achieve doing this and the path I take to get there, as well as the reasoning behind it all.

#### Certificates

In 2016 I obtained my Anglia Proficiency certificate with a "Distinction" grade. This shows that I master the English language on at least C1 level on the [CEFRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) scale.

#### Leisure

Because I strongly believe in free(/open source) software, I try to contribute to this cause where possible. In my spare time I read a lot of books, mostly non-fiction books about philosophy, history, linguistics and the classics.

I also like to play chess. Feel free to [challenge me on Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/lucianonooijen)
