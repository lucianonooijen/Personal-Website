#### Introduction

Because my availability and preferences for projects change regularly, I have added this page to my website, specifically for recruiters, where I can answer most questions.

To read about me as a person and my background, go to the [about](/about)-page. For my resume, go to the [resume](/resume) page.

### Availability and travel time

**Currently I _am_/~~am not~~ open to new freelance/contract work as a software engineer**

My availability per week is, starting November 1st:

* A total of 32 hours a week
* All remote working

Currently I have an hourly rate of â‚¬80-100 depending on the project details and payment period. This hourly rate is all-in but excludes VAT.

_My preference is for a project with an initial duration of 3-6 months, with extension in consultation_.

#### Techniques

*In order to deliver the highest possible value by delivering a high quality solution, it is important to me that <b>[my working method](/expertise#working-method)</b> can be implemented in projects.*

My preference is for projects where I work closely with the CTO/CIO of a company, lead developers and/or software architects, or where I fulfill one of these roles.

Currently I am available for a project with one or more of the following techniques, or a project where these techniques can be implemented:

* Golang for the back-end.
* ReactJS (+Redux) for the front-end
* React Native (+Expo) for mobile
* DevOps/Cloud automation with Linux environments
* Site Reliability Engineering (f.e. with Kubernetes)

_Unfortunately it is not possible for me to work with environments that require the Windows operating system._

To read more about my skills, go to the [expertise page](/expertise). Here, my working method is also explained in more detail.

#### Work and sector

I like variety very much, so I don't have a strong preference to work in a certain sector, or in a specific role that I would take on, but of course I have things that mainly interest me.

My interests are mainly:

* _Software architecture_ and determining the direction in the technical field within companies or teams
* Improving the _developer experience_ using _CI/CD_ to speed up development and operations
* The _inventing_ and _developing_ of internal tools to improve (development) processes.
* _Consultancy_ in the IT field, and creating and translating requirements into the best technical interpretation
* _IT automation_ within a company and _systems integration_ (creating links between different applications)
* Contributions to _open-source/free software projects_ of companies
* _Startups_ where software is the main focus

_I am open to both greenfield and brownfield projects, with no strong preference_

#### Team and mindset

Just as important as the work, I find the team and the mindset.

Within a team, I find it important that there is a culture that motivates people to write clean code and where quality of the software is paramount, so a mindset that fits [my way of working](https://lucianonooijen.nl/expertise/#working-method).

Whether the team is English-speaking or Dutch-speaking does not matter to me, because I master the English language on a near-native level.
