Recently, I have had quite a lot of ideas about interesting blog posts, some short, some long; some general notes and some more technical. All in the hope that this can be helpful or at least somewhat insightful for others.

I have updated my website to add slightly better blog support, including categories and tags to make this possible/

Currently, the website is quite basic. And although I have considered giving it a bit of an overhaul with better styling, I would prefer to keep this website somewhat minimalist. I might make some changes to improve readability, but the styling itself will still be very minimalistic.

Anyway, that's it for now!
