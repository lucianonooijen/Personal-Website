Recently, I have had quite a lot of ideas about interesting blog posts, some short, some long; some general notes and some more technical. All in the hope that this can be helpful or at least somewhat insightful for others.

I have updated my website to add slightly better blog support, including categories and tags to make this possible, plus better RSS feed support.

Currently, the website is quite basic. And although I have considered giving it a bit of an overhaul with better styling, I would prefer to keep this website somewhat minimalist. I might make some changes to improve readability, but the styling itself will still be very minimalistic.

Anyway, that's it for now!
