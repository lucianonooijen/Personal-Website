## Welcome

Big thanks for checking out my personal blog!

As of today, my website is completely in English and I've also added [my learning page](/learning) on here, where I tell about my learning path to try and become a self-taught computer scientist.

With this, I've also added this blog on my website, where I'll be posting from time to time about my experiences in learning, or to share information I hope will be valuable to others.

I'm also thinking about giving my site an overhaul, to improve the styling, readability and responsiveness and to add some features, but until this website is booming with traffic, I think this site will be more than just fine.

Anyway, that's it for now!
