My name is Luciano Nooijen, freelance software engineer with expertise in building web applications and multiplayer game development. I have a broad set of experience, ranging from technical lead positions in FAANG, to comitting the first lines of code for pre-seed start-up ventures.

As a former co-founder of a digital agency called Bytecode, I have been involved with many start-up ventures, bringing valuable experience in making the right (technical) decisions and being able to get software up and running rapidly.

With my knowledge about both theoretical computer science and my broad practical experience for many different types of companies, my aim is to not to create cookie-cutter solutions, but to create future-proof software tailored for the specific use-case.
