My name is Luciano Nooijen, a software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a broad range of experience. My work spans from leading technical teams at FAANG-level companies to writing the first lines of code for pre-seed startups.

I specialize in multiplayer game development, focussing on engine programming and online client development. Alongside this, I am often involved in building supporting tooling, meaning I get to keep my web and backend skills sharp as well.

Beyond technical implementation, I enjoy contributing at a higher level, ensuring the right business and architectural decisions are made. As a former co-founder of Bytecode Digital Agency, I've worked with many start-ups, helping them make critical decisions and rapidly bring software to life.
