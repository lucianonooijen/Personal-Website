_Methods I employ to deliver elegant, efficient, readable, understandable and maintainable code that adds value to a company and/or product._

- "Always choose the best tool for the job"
- Cloud and application structure using [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
- Software architecture via a simplified version of the principles of [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [Layered Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture).
- Prevention of [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt), short term and long term
- Everything (even [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)) in version control (Git) via [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

- Bringing together Development, Security and Operations through [DevSecOps](https://www.devsecops.org/) and [secure by design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design).
- Prioritise via the [MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) and the [80 / 20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).
- Development on the basis of Test-Driven Development (TDD) when it makes sense
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) code
- Versioning according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Adhere to the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
